For the JavaScript quiz I spent many many hours playing with the code to try and get it to do what I needed it to for the assignment. I managed to get a lot done and I am proud of what I accomplished but there are still something things that need fixing. 

The timer was super challenging to me because there aren't many examples or explanations on how to implement a timer like that, that isn't a countdown for a specific calender date which isn't what I wanted. But once I found what I was looking for I did get it to work. Obivously there is a flaw in the fact that you can take the quiz without hitting the start button and the timer won't start. Also when you end the quiz my timer does keep going until it runs out of time and then it stops. 

I also struggled with the saving scores to the local storage and getting them to save. I got the form to put the initals in, I have the submit button that reveals the score you recieved but I couldn't figure out how to get it to save the score. 

Overall I am pretty happy with this quiz but I am going to go over it in my spare time and fix the few errors that I have to make it fully functioning.
